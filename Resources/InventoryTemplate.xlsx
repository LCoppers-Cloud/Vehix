/*
This is a placeholder for the InventoryTemplate.xlsx file.

In a real project, you would need to:
1. Create an Excel file with the following columns:
   - Name (required)
   - Category (required)
   - Description
   - PartNumber
   - Unit (required)
   - Cost
   - Price
   - Quantity (required)
   - ReorderPoint
   - TargetStock
   - Location
   - Supplier
   - Notes

2. Add sample data and formatting to make it user-friendly

3. Add this file to your Xcode project's Resources group

The actual file would be binary and not a text file like this.
