# iOS 18 SwiftUI Code Complexity Fix

## The Problem
Swift compiler in iOS 18 can sometimes fail with 'unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time' when complex nested view structures are used in SwiftUI. This is particularly common in views with deeply nested conditionals or many modifiers.

## The Solution
1. Break down complex view hierarchies into smaller components
2. Extract conditional logic into separate view properties
3. Create dedicated helper methods for complex operations
4. Use Group/ViewBuilder to simplify conditional layout

## Implementation Pattern
Instead of:
```swift
if condition1 {
  // complex view 1
} else if condition2 {
  // complex view 2
} else {
  // complex view 3
}
```

Use:
```swift
Group {
  if condition1 {
    extractedView1
  } else if condition2 {
    extractedView2
  } else {
    extractedView3
  }
}

// Then define each extracted view as a computed property
private var extractedView1: some View { ... }
private var extractedView2: some View { ... }
private var extractedView3: some View { ... }
```

This approach keeps the compiler happy and makes the code more maintainable.
